        One of the world’s longest running soul events will hit Melbourne in 2016, when the city hosts the 19th Australian National Northern Soul Weekender.

        The cream of Australian and New Zealand DJs will showcase the best of their rare soul collections over three spectacular nights in the world’s most liveable city.  You’ll hear traditional Northern soul, R&B, modern and crossover in dedicated rooms—and in the spirit of all weekenders—on original vinyl only.
